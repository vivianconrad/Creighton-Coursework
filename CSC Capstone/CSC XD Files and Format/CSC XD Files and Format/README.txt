So I've included screenshots of what it should look like as a reference. I've also divided all of the folders up according to the screenshots. I didn't want to add  elements over and over again, so look back on other folders if you are missing something (Or tell me and I will fix it). I didn't add any text at all, I know I needed to keep them out of at least the task boxes and things like that, but didn't know about the rest. If I need to resend them with text I plan on staying in the classroom for actual class time Wednesday to just work so I can also do that if needed. Hopefully this all makes sense lol. If not, just let me know.
